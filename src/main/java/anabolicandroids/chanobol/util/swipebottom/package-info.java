// TODO: This is currently not used because it's not as easy as embedding
// a SwipeRefreshLayoutBottom inside a SwipeRefreshLayout to get a swipe
// functionality from both top and bottom (I tried ;)). However, it should
// be possible to create a top/bottom/top&bottom configurable SwipeRefreshLayout
// from this code. The author put TODOs wherever he adapted the support library's
// original code to make it work for pull from bottom, so the relevant places
// for adaption are already marked.
